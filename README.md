# Rock Paper Scissors Game 

The application is the web-based version of Rock-Paper-Scissors which is a hand game between two people in which each player simultaneously forms one of three shapes with an outstretched hand. These three shapes are rock, paper, scissors.A player who decides to play rock will beat another player who has chosen scissors ("rock crushes scissors" or sometimes "blunts scissors"[1]), but will lose to one who has played paper ("paper covers rock"); a play of paper will lose to a play of scissors ("scissors cuts paper"). If both players choose the same shape, the game is tied and is usually immediately replayed to break the tie. More on that (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_paper_scissors).

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
