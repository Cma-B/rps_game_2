## Rock Paper Scissors Game

Rock Paper Scissors is a hand game between two people in which each player simultaneously forms one of three shapes with an outstretched hand. These three shapes are rock, paper, scissors.A player who decides to play rock will beat another player who has chosen scissors ("rock crushes scissors" or sometimes "blunts scissors"[1]), but will lose to one who has played paper ("paper covers rock"); a play of paper will lose to a play of scissors ("scissors cuts paper"). If both players choose the same shape, the game is tied and is usually immediately replayed to break the tie. More on that (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_paper_scissors).

## Motivation

The project is the web based version of Rock-Paper-Scissors bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). The programming challenge is a simulation of a job interview and has been conducted by Craft Academy to assess my coding skills, level of ambition and ability to execute a solo project.
